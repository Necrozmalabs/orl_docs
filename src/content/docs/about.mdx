Open Research Laboratory is a web-based platform that empowers scientists, researchers, educators, and innovators to **run, share, and collaborate on scientific experiments** in a powerful virtual environment. Developed by **Necrozma Labs**, our mission is to make advanced experimentation globally accessible and open-source by default.


### Our Vision

We imagine a future where scientific tools and knowledge are **universal**, unrestricted by location, affiliation, or funding. Open Research Laboratory exists to remove traditional barriers and foster **open, inclusive, and collaborative science** for all.


### What We Offer

- A cloud-based digital lab with a wide range of simulated equipment  
- Tools to **create**, **publish**, and **document** your experiments  
- Collaborative infrastructure for versioning and contributions  
- Open-source licensing by default, with support for custom licenses  
- Optional paid features like private lab sessions and advanced simulation modules


### Why Open Source?

We believe that science progresses faster and better when it’s shared. That’s why every experiment uploaded is **open by default**, enabling others to:

- Reproduce and verify results  
- Build on top of prior work  
- Collaborate across disciplines and borders

You can apply your own license if you prefer to restrict use, but our core ecosystem thrives on openness.


### Backed by Necrozma Labs

Open Research Laboratory is built and maintained by **Necrozma Labs**, a research and innovation-focused organization leveraging AI, cloud, and simulation technologies to solve the world’s toughest scientific challenges.

Our platforms are designed to scale with your ideas — whether you're a high school student, a university professor, or a startup team building frontier tech.
