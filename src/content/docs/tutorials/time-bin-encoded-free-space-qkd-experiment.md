title: Time-bin Encoded Free-space QKD Experiment 
description: Time-bin encoding quantum key distribution in free-space horizontal links during nighttime and daytime
---


### Background & Motivation

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) enables **unbreakable encryption** by relying on the principles of quantum mechanics. While **fiber-based QKD** is already in advanced deployment in metropolitan networks, **free-space QKD** is essential for **satellite-to-ground communication** and for building the **global quantum internet**.

However, these two types of QKD use **different technologies**:

- **Fiber QKD** uses:
  - **C-band infrared light** (1550 nm) for low-loss in silica fibers.
  - **Time-bin encoding**, as polarization can fluctuate in fibers.

- **Free-space QKD** uses:
  - **Visible or near-infrared light** for better beam divergence control.
  - **Polarization encoding**, since it's robust against atmospheric effects.

This creates a **compatibility problem** between ground-based fiber users and satellite-based free-space links.

### What the Original Paper Tried to Achieve

> **Paper Title:**  
> *Time-bin encoding quantum key distribution in free-space horizontal links during nighttime and daytime*  
> **Authors:** Sebastiano Cocchi et al.  
> **arXiv:** [2501.08891v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08891)

#### Objective:
To demonstrate that **time-bin encoding**, typically used in fibers, can be reliably used in **horizontal free-space channels**, allowing **direct interoperability** between **fiber networks and satellite free-space links** using the **same protocol and wavelength**.

#### Key Highlights from the Paper:
- Implemented time-bin QKD using a **three-state BB84 protocol** with **one-decoy method**.
- Operated at **C-band (1558.98 nm)** using **horizontal free-space links**:
  - One **50-meter link** (lab-to-lab).
  - One **500-meter link** (museum-to-lab).
- Achieved high key rates:
  - **793 kbps** over 50m.
  - **40 kbps** over 500m.
- Used a **photonic integrated circuit** and **adaptive optics** (deformable mirrors) for beam stabilization.

### Our Experiment – Replication with a Twist

We replicated this setup in a simulated **open research lab** environment, following all experimental design elements from the paper, but under **extremely high attenuation (75 dB)**. This tests the protocol’s robustness in worst-case optical loss conditions—useful for **longer-range** or **deep-space QKD** feasibility studies.

### Mathematical Formulas Used

#### Secure Key Rate in Finite Key Regime:

$$
\text{SKR} = R_{\text{sifted}} \cdot \left[1 - f_{\text{EC}} \cdot H_2(\text{QBER}_Z) - H_2(\text{QBER}_X)\right]
$$

Where:

- $$ H_2(p) = -p \log_2 p - (1 - p) \log_2(1 - p) $$  
  *Binary entropy function*

- $$ f_{\text{EC}} = 1.1 $$  
  *Error correction inefficiency*

- QBER values come from measurement basis statistics.

### Conclusion

Despite the extremely high attenuation of 75 dB, our simulation demonstrated that time-bin encoding in C-band can still yield a non-zero secure key rate, validating the robustness of the BB84 protocol in harsh conditions.

This replication experiment confirms the original work’s interoperability promise and further stress-tests the setup in regimes relevant for future deep-space or satellite-based QKD.
