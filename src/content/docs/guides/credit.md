description: Learn how the Necrozma Open Research Laboratory credit system works and how to request more.
---


Welcome to the Credit System guide for the **Necrozma Open Research Laboratory**. This system ensures fair, accessible, and trackable use of our high-fidelity scientific simulations and lab tools.

Credits act as virtual tokens that are consumed whenever a user runs a simulation or adds equipment to an experiment or workflow.


### Free Credits for New Users

Every new user who signs up on the platform receives **50 free credits as the part of Open Research Laboratory Early Adopter Program**.

This is more than enough to:
- Run multiple experiments
- Try out advanced components
- Build and test entire workflows

You can monitor your remaining credits at any time from your profile dashboard.

### Component Costs

Each lab component has an associated **credit cost**, depending on its complexity, data output, and compute intensity.

| Component                  | Example Cost (Credits) |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Basic instruments (Multimeter, Oscilloscope) | 3–5 |
| Intermediate tools (Laser, Function Generator) | 5–7 |
| Advanced systems (Quantum Simulators, Plasma Emitters) | 8–10 |

**Experiments** can contain one or multiple components — you'll only be charged for the components you use.

**Workflows** may use many components across multiple steps — credits will be consumed based on total usage.


### How to Use Credits Effectively

Here are some strategies to make the most of your available credits:

#### 1. Plan Ahead
Before starting an experiment or workflow:
- Select only the components you truly need.
- Use the simulation preview feature to avoid trial-and-error runs.

#### 2. Combine Tools in Workflows
Instead of running separate simulations, **link multiple steps into a single workflow**. This can reduce redundant component calls and optimize credit consumption.

#### 3. Reuse Configurations
Save frequently used setups as templates or presets. This helps avoid reconfiguring everything from scratch and ensures efficiency.



#### Requesting Additional Credits

If you’ve used up your credits and need more, you have multiple options:

#### Apply for a Credit Refill

### Summary

- **New users** get **50 credits** automatically
- **Each component** costs between **3–10 credits**
- Use workflows and presets to save credits
- **Request credits** if you run out
- No cost for signing up, experimenting, or exploring
