Welcome to the **Open Research Laboratory**, an advanced research platform where researchers, students, and enthusiasts can conduct experiments using highly accurate virtual lab components.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started, from understanding the platform’s core features to creating experiments, managing your credits, and following best practices.


## Quick Start (3 Simple Steps)

1. **Sign up / Log in** – Create your account and receive 50 free credits.
2. **Create Your First Experiment** – Choose a lab, enter you research details, create components using View AI.
3. **Run & Observe** – Run your first experiment and analyze the result. You can customize which output values are tracked and visualized by configuring the Research Details.

- Note: If you are affiliated with a partner institution, you may be eligible for additional credits. Learn more about institutional benefits [here](/guides/how-to-redeem-partner-perks/).

## Experiments

An **experiment** in Open Research Laboratory is a virtual representation of a scientific test. You can include a single component (like a Multimeter) or multiple devices to conduct complex simulations. Think of it like setting up a real lab table — choose your tools and run your test.

### How to Create an Experiment

**Step-by-step Instructions:**

1. **Log into your account**

   * If you’re new, you’ll automatically receive **50 free credits**.

2. **Click on "+ Experiment"**

   * You’ll find this option in your navigation.

3. **Select Your Lab**

   * Choose the lab based on your interest:

     * Quantum Computing Lab
     * Physics Lab (in development)
     * Electronics Lab (in development)
     * More labs are being added!

4. **Enter Research Details**

   * Provide essential information about your experiment, including the objective, expected outputs, and any key parameters. This step is crucial for the View AI Assistant to accurately configure and run your experiment within the Open Research Laboratory.

      * Think it like giving execution guidelines to your fellow researcher.

5. **Use Research Components via View**

      Add components effortlessly using plain text prompts. Just say “add a laser”, and View AI will handle the rest.

6. **Start**

   * Credits will be deducted based on selected components.
   * Results are shown in real-time, but it may take upto 10 mintues depending on your experiment complexity.
