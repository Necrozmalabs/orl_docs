description: A comprehensive guide to using Necrozma Open Research Laboratory for experiments and workflows.
---

Welcome to the **Open Research Laboratory**, an advanced open-source simulation platform where researchers, students, and enthusiasts can conduct experiments using highly accurate virtual lab components.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started, from understanding the platform’s core features to creating experiments and workflows, managing your credits, and following best practices.


### Key Features:

* Realistic component simulations
* Drag-and-drop workflow builder
* Lab-specific environments (Physics Lab, Quantum Lab, etc.)
* Workflow chaining for advanced experiments
* Free credits for new users to explore

## Experiments: The Core of Research

Experiments are the building blocks of research on Open Research Laboratory. Each experiment is a self-contained setup where you can test your theories, validate models, or learn through simulation.

### What is an Experiment?

An **experiment** in Open Research Laboratory is a virtual representation of a scientific test. You can include a single component (like a Multimeter) or multiple devices to conduct complex simulations. Think of it like setting up a real lab table — choose your tools and run your test.

### How to Create an Experiment

**Step-by-step Instructions:**

1. **Log into your account**

   * If you’re new, you’ll automatically receive **50 free credits**.

2. **Click on "+ Experiment"**

   * You’ll find this option either in your dashboard or in the sidebar.

3. **Select Your Lab**

   * Choose the lab based on your interest:

     * Physics Lab
     * Quantum Computing Lab
     * Electronics Lab
     * More labs are being added regularly!

4. **Use View Research Assistant**

      * Generated intelligently** using View AI with plain text prompts

5. **Assign values**

   * Give values to the components.

6. **Start**

   * Credits will be deducted based on selected components.
   * Results are shown in real-time, and you can interact with the components live.


## Understanding the Credit System

Necrozma operates on a credit-based model to ensure fair usage and sustainability of simulations.

#### Key Rules:

* All new users get **50 free credits**.
* Each component has a **cost between 3 to 10 credits**.

#### Credit Tips:

* Use preview descriptions before selecting a component.
* Combine multiple components in one experiment to maximize credit value.
* Re-run saved experiments without reconfiguring (but still costs credits).

**You can top up credits in the billing section. Discounts available for verified students and institutions.**
