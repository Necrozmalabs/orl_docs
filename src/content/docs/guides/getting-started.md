description: A comprehensive guide to using Necrozma Open Research Laboratory for experiments and workflows.
---

Welcome to the **Necrozma Open Research Laboratory**, an advanced open-source simulation platform where researchers, students, and enthusiasts can conduct experiments using highly accurate virtual lab components. Whether you’re exploring physics, electronics, or quantum systems, Necrozma provides a powerful and intuitive virtual space to test, learn, and innovate.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started, from understanding the platform’s core features to creating experiments and workflows, managing your credits, and following best practices.

### Introduction 

Necrozma is a web-based platform designed to simulate real-world lab scenarios. The components you interact with — such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, function generators, and quantum simulators — are built to reflect their real-life behavior as closely as possible.

#### Key Features:

* Realistic component simulations
* Drag-and-drop workflow builder
* Lab-specific environments (Physics Lab, Quantum Lab, etc.)
* Workflow chaining for advanced experiments
* Free credits for new users to explore

### Experiments: The Core of Research

Experiments are the building blocks of research on Necrozma. Each experiment is a self-contained setup where you can test your theories, validate models, or learn through simulation.

#### What is an Experiment?

An **experiment** in Necrozma is a virtual representation of a scientific test. You can include a single component (like a Multimeter) or multiple devices to conduct complex simulations. Think of it like setting up a real lab table — choose your tools and run your test.

#### How to Create an Experiment

**Step-by-step Instructions:**

1. **Log into your account**

   * If you’re new, you’ll automatically receive **100 free credits**.

2. **Click on "+ Experiment"**

   * You’ll find this option either in your dashboard or in the sidebar.

3. **Select Your Lab**

   * Choose the lab based on your interest:

     * Physics Lab
     * Quantum Computing Lab
     * Electronics Lab
     * More labs are being added regularly!

4. **Choose Components**

   * You’ll see a list of available components with a description and credit cost.
   * Click on the ones you want to use (you can select multiple).

5. **Assign a Name and Description**

   * Help yourself and others understand what the experiment is about.

6. **Start Simulation**

   * Credits will be deducted based on selected components.
   * Results are shown in real-time, and you can interact with the components live.



#### Example Use Case:

"Test the waveform output of a function generator on an oscilloscope."


### Workflows: Simulating a Full Research Pipeline

A **workflow** allows you to chain multiple components across labs or systems. This is useful for simulations that involve stages — like data collection, processing, and output.

#### What is a Workflow?

Workflows are **multi-step simulations** where the output of one component can be used as the input for another. For example, a quantum signal generator’s output can be analyzed via a logic analyzer and interpreted by a visual module.

#### Creating a Workflow

Necrozma makes it easy with a **drag-and-drop** interface.

**Steps to Create a Workflow:**

1. **Go to the Header**

   * Click on **"+ New Workflow"** from the top navigation bar.

2. **Name Your Workflow**

   * Use a meaningful name like "Quantum Entanglement Study" or "Thermal Stress Workflow"

3. **Select Your Lab Environment**

   * You can use components across labs (inter-lab workflows are supported).

4. **Drag and Drop Components**

   * Use the visual builder to drag components onto the canvas.
   * Connect them in the sequence you want them to run.

5. **Check Credit Usage**

   * You’ll see how many credits each component will cost before running.

6. **Run the Workflow**

   * Watch your full simulation execute step-by-step.

#### Example Use Case:

"Generate a signal → Amplify it → Analyze using Spectrum Analyzer → Visualize results."


### Understanding the Credit System

Necrozma operates on a credit-based model to ensure fair usage and sustainability of simulations.

#### Key Rules:

* All new users get **100 free credits**.
* Each component has a **cost between 3 to 10 credits**.
* You are only charged **when you run** an experiment or workflow — setup is free.

#### Credit Tips:

* Use preview descriptions before selecting a component.
* Combine multiple components in one experiment to maximize credit value.
* Re-run saved experiments without reconfiguring (but still costs credits).

**You can top up credits in the billing section. Discounts available for verified students and institutions.**
