title: Quantum Lab
description: Build and simulate quantum error correction codes and hardware-level experiments using natural language with View Research Assistant.
---

The **Quantum Laboratory** in the Open Research Laboratory empowers users to explore cutting-edge quantum computing concepts. It is designed to support high-accuracy experimentation in **quantum error correction**, **custom code development**, and **quantum hardware integration**.

All components in the Quantum Lab have a **credit cost of 8**.

This lab is fully integrated with the **View Research Assistant**, allowing you to build, modify, and simulate quantum experiments simply by describing your intent in natural language. From stabilizer codes to surface codes to hardware-level circuit designs — View handles the technical details.

### Usage Guide

1. **Enter the Lab:** Open the Quantum Lab through the Open Research Laboratory interface.
2. **Use View Research Assistant:** Describe your experiment or code. For example:
   - *"Create a 7-qubit Steane code and simulate a phase-flip error."*
   - *"Connect a quantum chip with three logical qubits using surface code architecture."*
3. **Modify or Customize:** Update code parameters, gate sequences, noise models, or hardware mappings just by describing the changes to View.
4. **Run the Simulation:** Initiate the quantum experiment. The lab runs your design using advanced quantum simulators.
5. **View Results:** Outputs include logical error rates, stabilizer measurements, decoding outcomes, and circuit visualizations.

No coding is needed — just describe your idea, and View will convert it into a working simulation.

### Disclaimer

This lab is for **educational and research use only**. While the simulations are high-accuracy, they are still virtual and may not exactly match real-world quantum hardware behavior.

By using this lab, you acknowledge that all outputs are **simulated approximations**. Real hardware implementations may yield different results. The creators of this platform are **not liable** for any decisions or consequences arising from its usage.

### Supported Research Areas

> Note: This list may not include the most recent updates, as new components are added regularly.

#### Quantum Error Correction (QEC)  
Design and simulate QEC codes like surface codes, Steane codes, and repetition codes. Analyze their behavior under noise and perform logical error analysis.

#### Custom Code Creation  
Develop your own quantum codes from scratch — define logical qubits, stabilizers, and decoding methods with full flexibility.

#### Code Modification  
Edit and improve existing QEC frameworks, modify decoding strategies, or adjust gate configurations and error models.
