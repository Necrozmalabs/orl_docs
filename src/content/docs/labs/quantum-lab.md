title: Quantum Lab
description: Perform high-accuracy quantum communication and cryptography experiments, supported by View Research Assistant.
---


The **Quantum Laboratory** in the Open Research Laboratory enables users to perform high-accuracy experiments in the quantum field. It focuses on **quantum communication** and **quantum cryptography**, allowing researchers and students to create, modify, and test Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols over simulated networks.

All components in the Quantum Lab have a **credit cost of 8**.

This lab is fully supported by the **View Research Assistant**, which allows users to interact with the lab via natural language. Simply describe the component or experiment you want to add, and View will handle the rest.

### Available Components

#### Weak Coherent Pulse Laser  
Generates weak coherent pulses for quantum key distribution.

#### Entangled Photon Source  
Produces pairs of entangled photons used in QKD protocols like E91.

#### Polarization Encoder (Alice)  
Encodes polarization states (H/V or ±45°) onto photons based on key bits.

#### Polarization Decoder (Bob)  
Measures polarization states to recover key bits using a chosen basis.

#### Beam Splitter  
Splits or combines quantum signals based on polarization or path.

#### Phase Modulator  
Applies a phase shift to photons, enabling phase-based encoding schemes like DPS-QKD.

#### Quantum Channel  
Simulates the transmission of quantum states through a lossy or noisy fiber or free-space medium.

#### Classical Authenticated Channel  
Used to publicly compare basis choices and perform error correction/reconciliation.

#### Single Photon Detector  
Detects single photons and measures their quantum state.

#### Bell State Analyzer  
Performs joint measurements in the Bell basis for protocols like entanglement-based QKD.

#### Error Correction Module  
Implements classical error correction over the raw key.

#### Privacy Amplification Module  
Compresses the corrected key to remove potential eavesdropper information.

#### Decoy State Generator  
Randomly varies pulse intensity to detect photon-number splitting attacks.

#### Quantum Random Number Generator  
Generates truly random bits from quantum processes for key generation.

#### Time-bin Encoder  
Encodes quantum information using photon arrival times in separate time bins.

#### Quantum Key Storage  
Stores the generated secure key after reconciliation and amplification.

### Usage Guide

1. **Enter the Lab:** Open the Quantum Lab through the Open Research Laboratory interface.
2. **Use View Research Assistant:** Speak or type what you want to build. For example:
   - *"Add a Weak Coherent Pulse Laser and connect it to a Polarization Encoder."*
   - *"Simulate a BB84 protocol using a quantum channel and photon detector."*
3. **Modify Components:** You can update angles, pulse rates, or any parameter by describing your changes to View.
4. **Run the Experiment:** Once your setup is complete, initiate the simulation. The lab will compute results using high-accuracy quantum simulation libraries.
5. **Review Output:** Visualizations, measurements, and key generation results will be provided in the output panel.

No manual coding is required to add components or run experiments—just describe your intent, and View will configure the lab accordingly.
