title: Quantum Communication Lab
description: Perform high-accuracy quantum communication and cryptography experiments, supported by View Research Assistant.
---


The **Quantum Communication Laboratory** in the Open Research Laboratory enables users to perform high-accuracy experiments in the quantum field. It focuses on **quantum communication** and **quantum cryptography**, allowing researchers and students to create, modify, and test Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols over simulated networks.

All components in the Quantum Lab have a **credit cost of 8**.

This lab is fully supported by the **View Research Assistant**, which allows users to interact with the lab via natural language. Simply describe the component or experiment you want to add, and View will handle the rest.

### Usage Guide

1. **Enter the Lab:** Open the Quantum Lab through the Open Research Laboratory interface.
2. **Use View Research Assistant:** Speak or type what you want to build. For example:
   - *"Add a Weak Coherent Pulse Laser and connect it to a Polarization Encoder."*
   - *"Simulate a BB84 protocol using a quantum channel and photon detector."*
3. **Modify Components:** You can update angles, pulse rates, or any parameter by describing your changes to View.
4. **Run the Experiment:** Once your setup is complete, initiate the simulation. The lab will compute results using high-accuracy quantum simulation libraries.
5. **Review Output:** Visualizations, measurements, and key generation results will be provided in the output panel.

No manual coding is required to add components or run experimentsâ€”just describe your intent, and View will configure the lab accordingly.

### Disclaimer

This laboratory is intended for **educational and experimental purposes only**. While it offers high-accuracy quantum simulations, real-world results may differ depending on your location, device, and environmental conditions.

By using this lab, you acknowledge that the simulations are **virtual approximations**. Results should be independently validated before applying them in real-world systems. The platform creators are **not responsible** for any consequences resulting from its use.

### Supported Research Areas

> Note: The list of research field shown may be outdated, as new components are added regularly.

#### QKD Creation (Make Custom QKDs)
Design and simulate quantum key distribution protocols using weak coherent pulses, polarization encoding, or time-bin encoding. Ideal for creating new QKD systems from scratch.

#### Modifying Exsisting QKDs 
Edit or improve existing QKD setups like BB84 or E91. Includes tools for adjusting entangled photon sources, detectors, and communication channels.

#### Quantum Network Design (QAD)

Build and test quantum communication networks using repeaters, trusted nodes, and QKD links. Supports simulation of quantum internet-like architectures.
