Welcome to **Open Research Laboratory**, a web-based research platform developed by **Necrozma Labs**, where users can upload, share, run, and collaborate on scientific experiments. By accessing or using this Platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Platform.

### 1. Platform Overview

Open Research Laboratory provides a virtual, cloud-based environment where individuals, institutions, and organizations can create, simulate, and publish scientific experiments. All users can view, contribute to, or build upon experiments unless explicitly restricted by a separate license agreement provided by the contributor.

### 2. User Contributions and Licensing

By uploading any content — including files, code, data, simulations, or experimental procedures ("Contributions") — to the Platform, you grant Open Research Laboratory and its users a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute your Contributions as open-source material, unless otherwise protected by a specific license attached to your upload.

You retain all rights to your intellectual property. If you do not want your content to be open-source, it is your responsibility to clearly attach a license or terms of use that override the default open-source policy.

### 3. Open Source Default

By default, all experiments uploaded to Open Research Laboratory are open-source and may be reused, modified, and shared by the community for educational or research purposes. This promotes transparency, collaboration, and global scientific advancement.

Necrozma Labs is not responsible for enforcing or verifying compliance with any custom license terms added by users. Users uploading content must ensure that licenses are valid and lawful.

### 4. Paid Services

The Platform offers both free and paid service tiers. Premium features, such as private projects, advanced equipment simulations, or priority collaboration tools, may require a subscription or one-time payment. All transactions are securely handled by third-party payment providers.

By subscribing, you agree to any pricing, billing, refund, and cancellation policies described on the Platform at the time of purchase.

### 5. User Responsibilities

You agree not to upload or share any content that is illegal, harmful, abusive, infringing, misleading, or in violation of intellectual property rights. Necrozma Labs reserves the right to remove any content that violates these rules or damages the integrity of the platform.

### 6. Platform Ownership

Open Research Laboratory is owned and operated by **Necrozma Labs**. All trademarks, branding, software, user interfaces, and designs are the property of Necrozma Labs and may not be copied or redistributed without prior written consent.

### 7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability

All content on Open Research Laboratory is provided **“as is”** without any warranties, either express or implied. Necrozma Labs does not guarantee the accuracy, reproducibility, or safety of any scientific experiment uploaded or executed on the Platform.

Necrozma Labs is not liable for any loss, damage, or harm arising from the use of the Platform, including but not limited to misuse of experiments, data inaccuracies, or third-party access to published content.

### 8. Termination

Necrozma Labs reserves the right to suspend or terminate any account or access to the Platform at its sole discretion, without notice, for any behavior deemed harmful, unethical, or in violation of these Terms.

### 9. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of **India**. Any disputes relating to the Platform shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of India.

### 10. Modifications

Necrozma Labs may update or modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be published on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Continued use of the Platform after changes implies your acceptance of the revised Terms.
